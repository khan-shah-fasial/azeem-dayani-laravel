                        In the four year journey from 2016 to 2019 Azeem has successfully
                        churned out 9 movie albums. All of these have been hit,
                        trendsetting and some record breaking. Awards and accolades being
                        a byproduct of quality music, Azeem has earned one for almost
                        every album. The journey has given Azeem the opportunity to work
                        with some of the most celebrated Singers, Musicians, Actors and
                        Directors.

                    <p class="animated-para the_journey_content">
                        From a marketing executive to a music supervisor, Azeem Dayani's
                        foray into the music industry is untraditional and inspiring.
                    </p>
                    <p class="animated-para the_journey_content">
                        While serving long hours as a marketing executive with various
                        production houses and their film making, Azeem spent most of his
                        free time listening to music. People observed him closely and got
                        amused by Azeem's distinct taste in music. Some presented Azeem
                        with interesting proposals insisted him to put his best step
                        forward and share his gifts and talents with the mass audiences.
                    </p>
                    <p class="animated-para the_journey_content">
                        Such offers proved to be a catalyst in Azeem's life as he
                        kicked-off the world of music. He jammed with 'Arko' to create
                        stimulating music. The duo created 'Dariya' and presented it for
                        approval. The collaborators were impressed by Azeem's keen ear for
                        music and offered him the job of a music supervisor to showcase
                        his talents. His role was to churn out the best music for movies
                        produced by those productions and oversee making the complete
                        album that did wonders for the projects in hand.
                    </p>
                    <p class="animated-para the_journey_content">
                        The song 'Dariya' got featured in 'Baar Baar Dekho' instead of
                        'Kapoor & Sons' as originally conceptualized. He has overseen the
                        incorporation and creation of "Bolna", "Saathi Rey", "Buddhu Sa
                        Mann", "Teri mitti", etc. along with the making of several
                        remixes. All these songs became part of most music lover's
                        playlists. And they continue to jam according to the mood.
                    </p>
                    <p class="animated-para the_journey_content">
                        He thoroughly believes in the spirit of teamwork. According to
                        him, " a single album is made of many people and their skills."
                        So, whenever working on remixes, Azeem insists on crediting the
                        original artists for the work.
